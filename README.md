This is a sample project with springboot web service providing REST API for some entities.
Use can your favorite OS, tools, IDE etc.

Tasks to be done:
* add unit tests for put (and fix any problems if found)
* add unit tests for delete (and fix any problems if found)
* figure out what's wrong with the current unit tests (testCreate and testGetList)
* currently the API uses the 'name' field as the ID - add a new (autogenerated) field 'id' and switch the API to work with id
* see if error handling can be improved
* add comments to the existing code base for readability
