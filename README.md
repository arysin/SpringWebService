This is a sample project with springboot web service providing REST API for some entities.

Tasks to be done:
* figure out what's wrong with the current unit tests
* currently the API uses the 'name' field as the ID - add a new (autogenerated) field 'id' and switch the API to work with id
* see if error handling can be improved
* add unit tests for both put and delete
* submit a pull request (for github), or submit a review (for gerrit)
* add comments to the existing code base for readability

Use your favorite OS, tools, IDE etc.
